<P><font size=5px>In a bid to increase green cover on university and college campuses, the University Grants Commission (UGC) has launched 'One Student, One Tree' campaign asking every student to plant a sapling during his/her stay in an institution.

    Under the initiative, UGC has directed vice-chancellors of universities to provide free saplings
     for plantation to the students.
    
    A student will be involved in nurturing a tree for the preservation of environment. 
    NSS and other allied departments in  in university may be instructed to ensure that at least one tree is planted
     by every student during his/her stay at the institution,
     UGC Secretary Prof. Jaspal Sandhu said in his letter to VCs

 <h3>One Student One Tree: Benefits</h3>
 <P><font size=5px>
     -Trees are an important part of every community. <br>
     -Our streets, parks, playgrounds and backyards are lined with trees that create a peaceful, aesthetically pleasing environment. <br>
     -Trees increase our quality of life by bringing natural elements and wildlife habitats into urban settings.<br>
    -We gather under the cool shade they provide during outdoor activities with family and friends.<br>
       -Many neighborhoods are also the home of very old trees that serve as historic landmarks and a great source of town pride.<br>

    -Using trees in cities to deflect the sunlight reduces the heat island effect caused by pavement and commercial buildings.<br>
    -Trees control climate by moderating the effects of the sun, rain and wind. Leaves absorb and filter the sunâ€™s radiant energy, 
    keeping things cool
     in summer.<br>
     - Trees also preserve warmth by providing a screen from harsh wind. In addition to influencing wind speed and direction,
      they shield us 
     from the downfall of rain, sleet and hail. <br>
    -Trees also lower the air temperature and reduce the heat intensity of the greenhouse effect by maintaining low levels of carbon dioxide.</font>
