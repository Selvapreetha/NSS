<P><font size=5px>Independence Day is annually celebrated on <b>15 August</b>, as a national holiday in India commemorating the nation's independence
     from the United Kingdom on 15 August 1947, the day when the UK Parliament passed the Indian Independence Act 1947 transferring legislative 
     reignty to the Indian Constituent Assembly. India still retained King George VI as head of state until its transition to full republican constitution.
     India attained independence following the Independence Movement noted for largely non-violent resistance and civil disobedience.
     Independence coincided with the partition of India, in which the British India was divided along religious lines into the Dominions 
     of India and Pakistan; the partition was accompanied by violent riots and mass casualties, and the displacement of nearly
      15 million people due to religious violence. On 15 August 1947, the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru raised 
      the Indian national flag above the Lahori Gate of the Red Fort in Delhi. On each subsequent Independence Day, the incumbent 
      Prime Minister customarily raises the flag and gives an address to the nation.[1] The entire event is broadcast by Doordarshan,
       India's national broadcaster, and usually begins with the shehnai music of Ustad Bismillah Khan.

     Independence Day is observed throughout India with flag-hoisting ceremonies, parades and cultural events. It is a national holiday.</font></p>

 <h3>Independence Day culturals: History</h3>
 <P><font size=5px>European traders had established outposts in the Indian subcontinent by the 17th century.
      Through overwhelming military strength, the British East India company subdued local kingdoms and established 
      themselves as the dominant force by the 18th century. Following the First War of Independence of 1857, the Government 
      of India Act 1858 led the British Crown to assume direct control of India. In the decades following, civic society gradually 
      emerged across India, most notably the Indian National Congress Party, formed in 1885.:123 The period after World War 
      I was marked by British reforms such as the Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms, but it also witnessed the enactment of the repressive
       Rowlatt Act and calls for self-rule by Indian activists. The discontent of this period crystallised into nationwide non-violent
        movements of non-cooperation and civil disobedience, led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.:167

    During the 1930s, the reform was gradually legislated by the British; Congress won victories in the resulting elections.:195–197 
    The next decade was beset with political turmoil: Indian participation in World War II, the Congress' final push for non-cooperation,
     and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism led by the All-India Muslim League. The escalating political tension was capped by Independence 
     in 1947. The jubilation was tempered by the bloody partition of the subcontinent into India and Pakistan</font>
