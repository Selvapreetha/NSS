 <h3>NSS DAY: History</h3>
 <P><font size=5px>After independence the University Grants Commission, headed by S. Radhakrishnan, recommended the introduction of voluntary 
     national service in academic institutions. This idea was again considered by the Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE) 
     at its meeting in January, 1950; after examining the idea and the experiences of other countries in this field, the board 
     recommended that students and teachers should devote time to voluntary manual work. In the draft first Five-Year Plan adopted by 
     the government in 1952, the need for social and labour service by Indian students for one year was stressed. In 1958 Jawaharlal Nehru,
      in a letter to the chief ministers, considered the idea of social service as a prerequisite for graduation. 
     He directed the Ministry of Education to formulate a suitable scheme for the introduction of national service into academic institutions.</font>
