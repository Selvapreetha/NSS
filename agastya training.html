<P><font size=5px>Agastya International Foundation (Agastya)[1] is an Indian education trust and non-profit organization based in Bangalore, 
    India whose mission is to spark curiosity(Aah!), nurture creativity(Aha!) and build confidence(Ha-Ha!) among economically disadvantaged 
    children and teachers in India.[2] A team of scientists, educators and entrepreneurs led by Ramji Raghavan founded Agastya in 1999. 
    Agastya’s founders include the late KV Raghavan, former chairman of Engineers India Limited and Dr. PK Iyengar [3] , former chairman of the

  <h3>Agashtya Training Program: Theme</h3>
  <P><font size=5px>To cultivate curiosity in children, to transform attitudes toward learning; and to accomplish both these objectives by 
      making hands-on science accessible — these are the guiding principles behind the many programs by Agastya International Foundation. 
      The Foundation is currently in the process of setting up a Bio-Discovery Center: a first-of-its-kind interactive learning space focused
       on Life Sciences. With this article, we seek to invite input from the scientific community to help in the creation of models, exhibits,
        and modules for this Center.</font></p>
