  <h3>Cleaning Activity: Theme</h3>
  <P><font size=5px>Around 150  students were selected from two classes and were divided in to five groups
    and were allotted to clean various areas in the campus. Teachers and PTA members
    were in charge of these groups.  The campus cleaning day was very much effective,
    since the students could  collect almost the entire plastic waste  from the campus. The
    collected  non degradable waste was taken by the municipal authorities.</font></p>
