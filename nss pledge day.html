<center><b><i><font size=10px>NSS PLEDGE DAY</i></b></center></font>
<P><font size=5px>Pledge of Allegiance Day on December 28th commemorates the date Congress adopted the “The Pledge” into the United
     States Flag Code. Congress formally gave recognition for the Pledge of Allegiance on December 28, 1945
     In 1923 and 1924, the National Flag Conference inserted text of the pledge into legislation.
     The Honor Pledge is a statement undergraduate and graduate students should be asked to write by hand and sign on examinations, papers, or other academic assignments. 
     The Pledge reads: I pledge on my honor that I have not given or received any unauthorized assistance on this assignment/examination.</font></p>
  <b>NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS:50</b>
  <h3>NSS pledge day: Theme</h3>
  <P><font size=5px>If a child is going to be made to say a pledge, it can be unethical to make them say 'under God' on this basis. 
      So the main reason that the pledge of allegiance is said in schools is to instill a sense of
       patriotism amongst students. </font></p>
