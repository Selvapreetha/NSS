<center><b><i><font size=10px>SCIENCE PROJECT</i></b></center></font>
<P><font size=5px>A science project is an educational activity for students involving experiments or construction of models in one of the
     science disciplines. Students may present their science project at a science fair, so they may also call it a science fair project.
      Science projects are done by students worldwide.</font></p>
  <b>NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS:50</b>
  <h3>Science Project : Theme</h3>
  <P><font size=5px>The page describes the steps needed to complete a science fair project and provides a sample project for you to learn from.
    This guide contains much of the information from the Introductory Level Guide (above). Additional material includes ways to help distinguish between different types of scientific studies,
     more detail about the experimental scientific method, and an introduction to experimental error.

 <h3>Science Project: History</h3>
 <P><font size=5px>A science fair is a competitive event, hosted by schools worldwide.
      The distinguishing characteristic of a science fair is that project entries employ the scientific
       method to test a hypothesis.[1] Science fairs are not exhibits or mere displays of projects. 
       Students present their science project results in the form of a report, display board, and/or
        models that they have created. Science fairs allow students in elementary, middle and high schools
         to compete in science and/or technology activities.[2] The goal of a science fair is for students to answer a question based on a 
         hypothesis. Students often work on science fair projects in addition to their school work. Therefore, most science fair entries are
          usually modified versions of existing experiments. Display boards help communicate the nuances of a project to science fair judges,
           visitors, and other entrants.</font>
